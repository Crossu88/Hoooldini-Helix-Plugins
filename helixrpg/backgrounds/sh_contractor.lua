BACKGROUND.name = "Mercenary"
BACKGROUND.description = "Some call you a bloodthirsty killer, but you prefer to be called a professional. Your work is seldom glorious or virtuous, but it is very lucrative. Being a mercenary is not just about the money though, it’s about the freedom as well. You’re not bound by allegiances, years-long contracts, or servitude. You are your own man, and you make the decisions.\n\nThat being said, you aren’t without standards. Your career is defined by your efficiency and your quality of work after all. Without that, you’d just be another armed thug. But that doesn’t mean you’re afraid to get your hands dirty. Being a mercenary is a complicated profession for good reason.\n\nYou work well with others freelancers, and know just how to speak with them. You also have an understanding of the inner working of mercenary companies, and can fit in much easier among them. On top of all that, you know the price of your work, and when the offer is right."
