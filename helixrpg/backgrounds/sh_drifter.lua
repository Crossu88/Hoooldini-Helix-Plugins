BACKGROUND.name = "Drifter"
BACKGROUND.description = "You were always an outsider, and tend to find yourself among other outcasts. However, that never bothered you. You prefer to go against the grain and decide your path yourself. Oftentimes that means spending time alone. But youâ€˜d rather choose solitude than loose bonds.\n\nBut when you do find yourself among like minded people, the bonds you forge last a lifetime. Drifters make families from strangers, and risk their lives for them. Networks of drifters are loose, informal, and held together by a faith in one another. Drifters live or die on these connections, and you are no exception to that.\n\nYou know how to pick out an outsider when you see one. Not only that, but if they have a reputation, then word of mouth has told you what that is. You can navigate the loose network of drifters, and garner the trust of other outcasts like you."
