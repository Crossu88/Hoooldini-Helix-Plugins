BACKGROUND.name = "Soldier"
BACKGROUND.description = "You are not just a fighter among the rabble. You fight for a creed. Whether that be personal honor, allegiance, virtue, or something else entirely, you’ve deemed it as a worthy reason to take up arms among your compatriots.\n\nHowever, your creed is not the sole reason for fighting. Comradery in itself is good enough a reason as well. You never fight alone, and have always acted as a small cog in a larger machine. You place your trust in your allies, and in turn, they place theirs in you. Wars, after all, are not won alone.\n\nYour experience among professional soldiers has taught you how to be present yourself when in their presence. In conversation among other veterans, you’re much more easily able to earn their trust. You are also able to understand the nature of structured militaries, and gain insight into their operations."
