BACKGROUND.name = "War Machine"
BACKGROUND.description = "You were created for the express purpose of fighting in battle. Your protocols dictated if, when, where, and how you were to engage the enemy. Your efficiency is nearly unmatched in war, and that is reflected by your results.\n\nBut that hasn’t taken away all of your autonomy. Somewhere buried deep behind your stringent methods, you maintain the ability to make your own decisions. While your capacity to do so may be limited, it’s what’s allowed you to adapt to the situations you’ve found yourself in.\n\nWhile your skills in combat are among the best, you are limited in other roles. You are unable to attune to magic and psionics under normal conditions, and your social skills are lacking. But with time, you may learn to adapt to this new world."
